# UAHCSProjectFA17
### Codename: Python

## Objective
To teach the basics of Python to those unfamiliar and apply them to an object-oriented programming example.

### Note
 This a very early and unspecific design document, as we are unsure of how to implement the more object-oriented variables.

## Overview
This is a project designed to expose members to Python and Object-Oriented programming (OPP).The project will consist of making a student class and setting and retrieving information from this class.Advancements will add more classes that can interact with the student class. This will consist of methods that will simulate different actions of students.

## Requirements
Club members will create a program of a student class.

The Program shall define a Student class
* The Student class should contain private variables as such:
     * String variable for name
     * List of floats for grades
     * Variables for knowledge, fitness
     * Double variable for stress
* The Student class may contain public functions as such:
     * Constructor
     * Get/Set Functions
     * GetName – will return the student’s name
     * GetGrades – will output the current grades of the student
     * GetKnowledge – will return the student’s knowledge level
     * GetStress – will return the student’s stress level
     * GetFitness – will return the student’s fitness level
     * SetName -  will set the student’s name
     * SetGrades - will set the student’s grades
     * SetKnowledge - will set the student’s knowledge
     * setStress - will set the student’s stress
     * setFitness - will set the student’s fitness

Student Variables
* Intelligencee
* Dexterity
* Fitness
* Name
* Stress

The Program shall define a Student class
* The Student class should contain private variables as such:
    * string variable for name
    * List of floats for grades
    * Integer Variables for knowledge, stress, fitness
