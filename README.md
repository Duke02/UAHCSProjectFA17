# UAHCSProjectFA17
## Codename: Python

This is the temporary code repository for the UAH CS Club Python Project for the 2017 Fall Semester.

## Purpose

This project is to create a college student and "simulate" their lives, in the sense of having variables such as
* Classes
* Clubs
* Credits
* etc

and having functions such as
* goToClass(whichClass)
* study(howMuch)
* haveExistentialCrisis(isSupportGiven)
* goToTheGym()
* getBuff(amtOfBuffness)
* skipLegDay(howBad)
* etc

## Goals for the Future
After the basis is formed, some aspects of the project will need to be figured out later in the semester such as
* Handle loading a college student from a file, as well as saving
* Making a database of college students?
* Making a text based adventure game for college students?
